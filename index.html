    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
    My name is Samaira and I am currently a sophomore in high school and I love all things tech! I recently started reading more into quantum computers because I was introduced to quantum computing by my dad and was instantly fascinated by them. Hopefully this website can get you interested in the topic of quantum computing too. Quantum Computers, like blockchain technology, Artificial Intelligence, and even Autonomous Driving are a technological advancement of the future and I would like to know as much about these topics as I can.
